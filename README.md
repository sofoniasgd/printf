C Group project

0x11. C - printf


* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

#GitHub
           * There should be one project repository per group. The other members do not fork or clone the project to ensure only one of the team has the repository in their github account otherwise you risk scoring 0%

#More Info

Authorized functions and macros

* write (man 2 write)
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* free (man 3 free)
* va_start (man 3 va_start)
* va_end (man 3 va_end)
* va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
* va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

#Compilation

* Your code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
* As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)
* Our main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h
* You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.

* We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests
* If the task does not specify what to do with an edge case, do the same as printf

Tasks 0

  * Write a function that produces output according to a format.

* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
* c
* s
* %
* You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
