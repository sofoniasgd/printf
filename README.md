0x11. C - printf




Authorized functions and macros

* write (man 2 write)
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* free (man 3 free)
* va_start (man 3 va_start)
* va_end (man 3 va_end)
* va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
* va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

#Compilation

* our code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
* As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)
* Our main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h
* You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.


Tasks 0

  * Write a function that produces output according to a format.

* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
* c
* s
* %
* You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
